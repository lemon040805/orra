# Voice Function Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Functions
- **Fixed**: Added missing `stopPracticeRecording()` function calls in modal close handlers
- **Changed**: `stopRecording()` â†’ `stopPracticeRecording()` in both modal close and click-outside handlers

### 2. Audio Recording Issues
- **Fixed**: Improved MediaRecorder initialization with proper MIME type checking
- **Added**: Support for `audio/webm` format (more widely supported than `audio/wav`)
- **Fixed**: Proper stream cleanup to prevent microphone staying active
- **Added**: Better error handling for microphone permission issues

### 3. Backend Multipart Form Parsing
- **Fixed**: Proper multipart form data parsing in both `voice_processor.py` and `voice_transcriber.py`
- **Added**: Boundary detection and field extraction from form data
- **Fixed**: Language configuration consistency across Lambda functions

### 4. Error Handling & User Experience
- **Added**: Comprehensive error messages for different failure scenarios
- **Added**: Fallback responses when backend services are unavailable
- **Added**: Better UI feedback during recording and processing states
- **Added**: Microphone permission help and troubleshooting guidance

### 5. Language Configuration
- **Fixed**: Consistent language code mapping between frontend and backend
- **Added**: Proper language code conversion for AWS Transcribe service
- **Fixed**: Fallback language handling when user preferences are missing

## Files Modified

### Frontend (`webapp/app.js`)
- Fixed modal close handlers
- Improved `startPracticeRecording()` with better error handling
- Enhanced `stopPracticeRecording()` with proper cleanup
- Upgraded `processPracticeRecording()` with comprehensive error handling and fallbacks

### Backend Lambda Functions
- `infrastructure/lambda/voice_processor.py`: Fixed multipart parsing and language handling
- `infrastructure/lambda/voice_transcriber.py`: Improved form data extraction and error handling

### Test File
- Created `voice-test.html`: Standalone test page to verify voice recording functionality

## Key Improvements

1. **Better Browser Compatibility**: Added MIME type checking and fallbacks
2. **Improved Error Messages**: Users get clear guidance when things go wrong
3. **Robust Fallbacks**: System works even when backend services are unavailable
4. **Proper Resource Cleanup**: Microphone and memory resources are properly released
5. **Enhanced User Feedback**: Clear status messages throughout the recording process

## Testing

Use the `voice-test.html` file to:
- Test microphone access and permissions
- Verify audio recording functionality
- Check browser compatibility
- Debug recording issues independently

## Next Steps

1. Test the voice functionality in the main app
2. Deploy the updated Lambda functions
3. Verify end-to-end voice practice workflow
4. Monitor for any remaining issues in production

The voice function should now work reliably across different browsers and handle errors gracefully.
